note right of UC_BOARD
  Kanban-style board showing:
  Acts (columns) →
  Sequences (cards) →
  Scenes (items)

  With statistics for each level
end note

note bottom of UC_S4
  When moving a sequence,
  all child scenes are
  updated with new act
  references
end note

note bottom of UC_SC4
  Moving scenes between
  sequences can also change
  the parent act
end note

note left of UC_SC6
  Scenes can have multiple
  locations assigned
end note

note left of UC_SC7
  Time of Day options:
  DAY, NIGHT, MORNING,
  AFTERNOON, EVENING, etc.
